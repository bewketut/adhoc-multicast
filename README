what you need
=============
You need iptables >= 1.4.3
and kernel-source >= 2.6.17  
tool: socat, vlc 

What it does
============
This module provides a filter for incoming multicast traffic by doing the f/g:
1. Snooping Subscibe (or join) messages and storing the client by its group
hash
2. We also snoop mulitcast source address (unicast type). This is the part where one sort of NEEDs to pierce a hole for the multicast (which can be seen in the second last line) source- its unicast address. We store the client by the multicast source hash.

3. When multicast trafffic come we hash both group and source address and
Checking if the client exists in both hashes.

testing (blocking and unblocking multicast traffic)
=======
For testing purpose do the following (need to be root) :
# sh test.sh 
Start vlc (www.videolan.org) stream video  on 238.234.234.1
Start extra vlc. Try to open the video on open network and entering the streamingaddress. It should NOT open.
You will have to choose UDP in both cases.

Then do the following (after changing the 192.x.x.x to your ip)  
echo "hi" | socat - udp-sendto:192.168.1.4:4444 
and it should now open

sim_test
========
This gives a userland simulator to what the kernel module is trying to do.

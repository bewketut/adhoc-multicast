This module provides a filter for incoming multicast traffic by doing the f/g:
1. Snooping Subscibe (or join) messages and storing the client by its group
hash
2. This is the part where one sort of NEEDs to pierce a hole for the multicast
source- its unicast address. We store the client by the multicast source hash.

3. when multicast trafffic come we hash both group and source address and
Checking if the client exists in both hashes.

You need iptables >= 1.4.3
and kernel-source >= 2.6.17 
tools: socat
make 
For testing purpose do the following (need to be root) :
# sh test.sh 
Stream video on vlc (www.vlc.org) on 238.234.234.1
Start extra vlc Try to open the video on open network and entering the streamingaddress.
You will have to choose UDP in both cases.

Then do the following (after changing the middle to your ip)
echo "hi" | socat - udp-sendto:192.168.1.4:4444 
Of course, you will have to change 192.168.1.4 to your own ip.
